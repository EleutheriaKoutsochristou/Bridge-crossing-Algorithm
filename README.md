# Bridge-crossing-AI-Algorithm
University Project: Solving the Bridge Crossing Puzzle using A* search algorithm

How to use: First, the user will be asked to provide the number of people waiting to cross the bridge. Then, they will need to give the name of each person as well as the time it takes them to cross the bridge in minutes. After that, the program will execute the A* algorithm and print the solution, if it exists, the time taken to find it, the order in which they cross, and how long each person took in minutes to cross.
